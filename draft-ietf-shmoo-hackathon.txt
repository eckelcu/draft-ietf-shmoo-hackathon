1.  Introduction

   IETF Hackathons encourage the IETF community to collaborate on
   running code related to existing and evolving Internet standards.
   IETF Hackathons aim to:

   *  Advance the pace and relevance of IETF standards activities by
      bringing the speed and collaborative spirit of open source
      development into the IETF

   *  Bring developers and young people into IETF and get them exposed
      to and interested in the IETF

   IETF Hackathons are free to attend and open to everyone.  Software
   developers are the primary audience, but participation by subject-
   matter experts who are not necessary developers is encouraged and
   very important as well.  Similarly, while the Hackathon is meant to
   attract newcomers and those who do not typically view themselves as
   standards people, long time IETF contributors, including Internet-
   Draft authors, working group chairs, and subject-matter experts, are
   key participants as well.  Group dynamics and blending of skillsets
   and perspectives are extremely valuable aspects of IETF Hackathons.

   In addition to the running code created and improved as a result of
   each Hackathon, the exchange of ideas, extensions of human networks,
   and establishment of trust, respect, and friendships are some of the
   most valuable outputs of each Hackathon.  Code written in a
   programming language can be more illustrative and less
   confrontational than opinions expressed during a meeting or in an
   email.  Working together to find common understanding of proposals,
   concerns, and solutions that result in improvements to evolving
   Internet standards is as important as the development of running code
   that implements or validates the correctness of these same proposals.

   Consequently, IETF Hackathons are collaborative events, not
   competitions.  Any competitiveness among participants is friendly and
   in the spirit of advancing the pace and relevance of new and evolving
   Internet standards.  IETF Hackathons are inclusive, not only in terms
   of who can participate but also in terms of the projects included in
   each Hackathon.  All projects should be related to existing or
   proposed Internet standards in some way.  Examples include, but are
   not limited to, interoperability of implementations, proof of
   concepts, and tools.

   IETF Hackathons foster an open environment, with much of the code
   being open source and projects results typically shared publicly.
   The Hackathon operates under the [NOTE-WELL]; however, the rules and
   terms around code are those of the license associated with the code.
   Although code is often and preferably open source, it may be
   proprietary as well.

   This document provides a set of practices that have been used for
   running IETF Hackathons.

2.  Timing

   The first IETF Hackathon was held the weekend before the start of the
   IETF 92 meeting.  The rationale was to avoid conflicts yet make it
   relatively convenient for those attending the IETF meeting to
   participate in the Hackathon as well.  Holding the Hackathon on the
   weekend was also viewed as making it more accessible to non IETF
   meeting participants, including students and working professionals
   who would have other commitments during the week.  The weekend before
   was viewed as better than the weekend after so that things learned
   during the Hackathon could be shared and discussed with the rest of
   the IETF community during working group sessions and the like.  This
   worked well at IETF 92, was repeated at IETF 93, and quickly became
   an established norm with the IETF meeting being officially extended
   to include the Hackathon at the start.  An additional benefit of this
   timing noted and appreciated by participants is that it serves as a
   more informal and social way to physically and mentally acclimate to
   changes in time zones and surroundings.

2.1.  Agenda

   The IETF Hackathon is a strenuous event.  Though not a competition,
   participants want to make the most of their time together, much as
   with the IETF meeting in general.  Competitive Hackathons typically
   run non-stop for on the order of 40 hours.  There is a strict
   deadline and teams are judged and winners declared at the end.
   Afterward everyone is wiped out and heads off to briefly celebrate or
   commiserate, but mainly to recuperate.  As the IETF Hackathon serves
   as the start of the overall IETF meeting, we aim to strike a
   compromise that provides enjoy time to get valuable work accomplished
   without exhausting themselves before the main IETF meeting even
   starts.  While some people participate in the Hackathon only, the
   majority of people remain and plan to be actively engaged in the rest
   of the IETF meeting.

   The typical agenda is as follows:

 Saturday before IETF meeting week
     08:30: Room open for setup by project champions
     09:00: Room open for all - Pastries and coffee provided
     09:30: Hackathon kickoff
     09:45: Form Teams
     12:30: Lunch provided
     15:30: Afternoon break - Snacks provided
     19:00: Dinner provided
     22:00: Room closes

 Sunday before IETF meeting week
     08:30: Room opens - Pastries and coffee provided
     12:30: Lunch provided
     13:30: Hacking stops, prepare brief presentation of project results
     14:00: Project results presentations to other participants
     15:45: Closing remarks and opportunities for next time
     16:00: Hackathon ends
     17:00: Tear down complete

   The time on Saturday morning provides team champions time for setup
   and participants time to socialize and learn more about projects and
   team they might want to join.  The kickoff presentation and
   formalities are kept to minimum to leave as much time as possible for
   team to work together with their team on their projects.  The
   proximity of teams to each other fosters communication and
   collaboration across teams as well.

   Lunch and dinner are provided as a convenience and an incentive to
   remain at the Hackathon.  Participants are free to come and go as
   they like.  It is well understood and accepted that there are other
   things vying for time and that meeting with friends and colleagues
   outside of the Hackathon is an entirely reasonable thing to do.

   The room closes Saturday evening to give hotel staff unfettered
   access to the room and to encourage people to pace and take care of
   themselves.  There are no rules against continuing work on projects
   outside of the Hackathon room.  Similarly, working on projects long
   before and after the Hackathon is allowed and encouraged.

   The end of the Hackathon on Sunday is driven by other IETF meeting
   events.  There typically are Newcomer events that start at 16:00.
   The IETF Hackathon typically includes many newcomers in its list of
   participants and it is important to provide them time to participate
   in the Newcomer events.  The opening reception for the IETF typically
   start at 17:00, and we want to make it easy for all Hackathon
   participants to join that as well.

   Hackdemo Happy Hour (Section 2.2) and the Code Lounge (Section 2.3)
   exist to facilitate ongoing discussion and work on projects beyond
   the official end of the Hackathon weekend.

2.2.  Hackdemo Happy Hour

   Hackdemo Happy Hour provides an opportunity for more in depth sharing
   and discussion than is possible within the time constraints of the
   result presentations that occur at the end of the Hackathon.  This
   opportunity is made available to all teams.  As with the results
   presentations, participation is optional.

   Initially, we did something similar as part of Bits and Bites.  This
   worked well for the Hackathon but the Bits and Bites event was
   eventually abandoned for other reasons.  Hackdemo Happy Hour was
   created as a low cost, informal event to provide a venue for the IETF
   community to engage with the Hackathon teams in more in depth
   discussions related to their projects.

   Hackdemo Happy Hour is typically Monday evening, roughly from 18:00 -
   19:30, often overlapping a bit with the last working group session of
   the day but continuing long enough to allow everyone an opportunity
   to join.  The goal is to make it convenient to attend by not
   conflicting with other meetings but also no running too late into the
   night.

   Light snacks and beverages are provided, and a cash bar is available
   to align with the spirit of a happy hour.

2.3.  Code Lounge

   The Code Lounge provides space for groups to gather and continue to
   collaborate on running code after the Hackathon.  It is typically in
   the IETF Lounge and open the same hours as the IETF Lounge.
   Champions are encouraged to look at the final agenda and determine
   time slots best suited to ensure attendance of Code Lounge sessions
   as well as any related working group sessions.  It is okay for
   multiple teams to sign up for the same time slots.  This is in fact
   encouraged for work that spans multiple working groups or projects.

2.4.  Code Sprint

   The IETF [CODE-SPRINT] develops tools that support the work of the
   IETF.  The Code Sprint existed long before the Hackathon and
   benefitted from being a focused event in a quiet space with few
   interruptions.  However, there is a great deal of synergy between the
   Code Sprint and the Hackathon, and they attract some of the same
   participants.  For example, some Hackathon projects, such as those
   related to YANG model validation, involve the creation or
   modification of IETF tools.  It is therefore advantageous to colocate
   these two events when practical, and when separate space is deemed
   helpful, to allocate spaces that are physically close to each other
   to make it easy for participants to switch back and forth between the
   two events.

2.5.  Online Only

   The IETF 107 Hackathon was originally scheduled to be the weekend at
   the start of the IETF meeting in Vancouver.  When COVID-19 hit and it
   became clear the IETF meeting could not occur in person, the
   Hackathon already had 23 projects and 176 registrations.  With only
   10 days until the anticipated start of the Hackathon, a [SURVEY] went
   out to the Hackathon community, including all project champions and
   registered participants, to see if they wanted to participate in the
   Hackathon exactly as planned except with everyone participating
   remotely rather than in person.  A relatively small number of people
   expressed interest in participating, with even fewer wanting to
   continue to champion their projects.  The fact that the Hackathon was
   planned for the weekend before the IETF meeting and in the local time
   zone, both of which were historically very convenient and attractive
   to Hackathon participants, suddenly became huge obstacles.
   Consequently, the IETF 107 Hackathon was cancelled.

   We knew more in advance that IETF 108 would be an online only
   meeting.  We moved and expanded the schedule to run the entire work
   week before the rest of the IETF meeting.  The Hackathon kickoff was
   set for Monday, the closing for Friday, with all the time in between
   left for individual project teams to arrange to meet how and when was
   most convenient for them.  The kickoff and closing sessions were
   schedule to align with the time frame established for the IETF 108
   meeting.  All of this was, of course, not ideal, and it worked much
   better for some people than for others, but at least everyone knew
   the plan and corresponding time commitment well in advance and had
   the ability to plan accordingly.

   We ultimately had 19 projects and almost 300 registrations.  It is
   hard to say how many people actually participated and for how long,
   but many projects were able to get substantial work done.  For the
   closing, 10 teams produced and shared presentations summarizing their
   findings and achievements.  All results presentations as well as the
   agenda and a recording of the closing session are available via the
   [IETF-108-HACKATHON-WIKI].  This level of participation was strong
   enough to be considered a success and justify including the Hackathon
   in future online only IETF meetings.

   Hackdemo Happy Hour and the Code Lounge are not applicable for online
   only Hackathons.

3.  Funding

   The Hackathon requires funding, and that funding increases with the
   number of participants.  Participating has always been free;
   therefore, funding from other sources than participant fees is
   required.

3.1.  Sponsorship

   The initial funding model was to have Hackathon sponsors sign up to
   sponsor and fund the Hackathon for one year.  As part of starting the
   Hackathon, Cisco volunteered to sponsor and fund the Hackathon for
   its first year (i.e., three Hackathons, one at each IETF meeting
   during a calendar year).  This sponsorship was to rotate.  Huawei
   volunteered to sponsor the second year of the Hackathon.  After the
   second year, a sponsor for the 3rd year was not found.  However, the
   Hackathon had become a proven success.  Consequently, the IETF
   decided to fund the Hackathon as part of the IETF meeting, with
   Hackathon sponsorship being on a best effort basis.

   Online only Hackathons in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
   increased remote participating in general, result in increased cloud
   infrastructure requirements that make Hackathon sponsorship more
   attractive to cloud infrastructure providers.

   Hackathon sponsorship is available at different levels as part of
   being an [IETF-RUNNING-CODE-SPONSOR].

3.2.  Expenses

   The primary expenses associated with the Hackathon are those for
   hosting an in-person event, e.g., meeting space, food and beverage,
   etc.  It is often challenging to quantify the portion of this
   associated with the Hackathon from that incurred for the IETF meeting
   overall.

3.2.1.  In-person Event Expenses

   The following expenses are associated with in-person participation in
   a Hackathon.  When the IETF meeting is online only, these expenses
   are eliminated.

3.2.1.1.  Meeting Space

   The meeting space for the Hackathon is sometimes included as part of
   the overall contract for the IETF meeting.  Other times, additional
   expense is incurred to secure a large enough space earlier than would
   otherwise have been required.  Typically, the space is needed for
   setup from Friday afternoon before the start of the IETF meeting
   until Sunday afternoon.  After the Hackathon, the space is typically
   repurposed for the IETF Lounge.  If the size of the Hackathon
   continues to increase, it might be necessary to use the same space as
   is later used for the IETF plenary.

3.2.1.2.  Food and Beverage

   Some portion of the food and beverage expense is often included as
   part of a minimum spend the IETF is obligated to make.  When a
   Hackathon sponsor is identified, funds resulting from this
   sponsorship are typically used to offset food and beverage expenses,
   or to increase the food and beverage budget.

   The minimum food and beverage for the Hackathon has been,

   *  coffee, tea, and water Saturday and Sunday morning

   *  lunch Saturday and Sunday

   Additional items, in order of importance, include,

   *  beer Saturday evening

   *  dinner Saturday evening

   *  continental breakfast Saturday and Sunday

   *  afternoon snacks Saturday and Sunday

3.2.1.3.  T-shirts

   Hackathon t-shirts are an important part of the Hackathon.  They have
   been provided for all in-person Hackathons and greatly appreciated by
   many participants.  They also serve as great advertising for the
   IETF, the Hackathon, and sponsors.  Cisco or other event sponsors
   have often covered expenses associated with t-shirts.  The current
   model is that the secretariat covers the expenses using whatever
   funding is available.

   The number of size distribution of t-shirts for IETF 107 is provided
   here as an example.

   *  380 t-shirts at a cost of roughly $10 USD / t-shirt with shipping
      to the Secretariat included

      -  50 Small

      -  120 Medium 

      -  110 Large

      -  75 XL

      -  25 XXL

   The t-shirts are all standard cut.  We previously tried providing
   fitted cut t-shirts as an option for Hackathon participants, but
   these were not well received.

3.2.1.4.  Stickers

   Laptop stickers are popular with developers.  Stickers have been made
   available at the Hackathon for those that want them.  Expenses have
   been covered by the IETF LLC, Director of Communications and
   Operations.

3.2.2.  Remote Participation Expenses

   The following expenses are associated things done primarily to
   facilitate remote participation in a Hackathon.  This includes
   participation when the Hackathon is online only as well as remote
   participation when the Hackathon is in-person.

   *  Meetecho: cost associated with Hackathon kickoff and closing

   *  Gather: costs associated with premium service, required to enable
      more than 25 concurrent users.  This has not been necessary, but
      will almost certainly be if Gather becomes a valuable way for
      Hackathon participants to meet within and across teams.

   *  Webex: IETF Webex accounts are made available to champions for the
      duration of the Hackathon and some period beyond that encompasses
      at least the rest of the IETF meeting.  These accounts are
      available at no additional cost to the IETF at present

   *  Network: setup and support of the IETF network, and remote access
      to it

   The change in timing and extended duration of the Hackathon at an
   online only IETF meeting increases the duration and use of remote
   participation facilities from 7 days to 12 days.  This may result in
   increases to the cost of providing these facilities.

4.  Project Presentations

   Project presentations are an important mechanism for capturing what
   each team intends to accomplish, what they actually accomplished, and
   sharing the results and findings with the IETF community.

   For the first few Hackathons, we had two very distinct types of
   presentations:

   1.  Presentations that served as project pitches at the start of the
       Hackathon

   2.  Presentations that summarized results at the end of the
       Hackathon.

4.1.  Project Pitches

   The project pitches were 5-10 minute presentations by a champion of a
   project describing what they wanted to do and how they proposed to
   accomplish it.  This gave everyone in the room a better understanding
   of all the projects and helped participants match themselves with
   appropriate projects.  This worked well when we had few projects, but
   it became unwieldy as the number of projects increased.  As knowledge
   of the Hackathon grew and advanced planning became more common, many
   participants knew exactly which team they planned to join and wanted
   to get to work as quickly as possible rather than spend time
   listening to presentations.  Project pitches were dropped from the
   Hackathon.  Champions are encouraged to share this type of
   information in advance via the Meeting Wiki (Section 5.4) instead.

4.2.  Project Results Presentations

   The project results presentations were brief presentations by each
   team of what problem they tried to solve, what they achieved, and
   highlights that included lessons learned, feedback to associated
   working groups, and collaboration with open source communities and
   other standards organizations.  They also highlight individuals who
   participated in their first IETF Hackathon or first IETF event, which
   helps facilitate the introduction of such individuals to the IETF
   community.  The production and presentation of results summaries is
   optional.  Fortunately, despite the lack of awards and prizes, most
   teams participate.

   As with the project pitches, project results presentations can become
   unwieldy as the number of projects increases.  With this in mind, the
   total time for all results presentations is limited to 2 hours.  The
   maximum duration of each presentation is calculated based on the
   number teams that indicate the desire to present.  This maximum is
   strictly enforced to ensure all teams have the opportunity to present
   their results.  Maximum durations of 3-5 minutes are typical.

4.2.1.  Templates

   Project results presentation templates provides guidance on what to
   cover.  The use of these templates is optional.  They are made
   available in various formats in a GitHub repo created specifically
   for the presentations for each IETF Hackathon, e.g.,
   [RESULTS-PRESENTATIONS].

4.2.1.1.  PPTX

   For portability, presentations that use this template should be made
   exported into PDF format as well.

4.2.1.2.  HTML format

   This template should render within any browser.  It can be rendered
   as a slideshow using [REMARK].

4.3.  Upload to GitHub

   All project results presentations are uploaded to the GitHub repo
   created the Hackathon, e.g., [RESULTS-PRESENTATIONS].  The contents
   of this repo are used as the source for all results presentations at
   the end of the Hackathon and remain as a reference after the
   Hackathon.

   One must be a member of the [IETF-HACKATHON-GITHUB] organization to
   upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation.

   To be added as a member, presenters are asked to:

   *  include the name by which they are known in their GitHub profile

   *  enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

   *  send your GitHub username to the Chair(s)

   Presenters are asked to do this at their earliest convenience as the
   Chair(s) typically get very busy as the start of presentations
   approaches.

4.4.  Presenting in Person

   Presentations are run from a shared ChromeBook at the front of the
   Hackathon room.  This Chromebook is provided by the Secretariat.

4.5.  Presenting Remotely

   Remote presenters are welcome to run their own presentations using
   the screen sharing functionality in Meetecho.  Alternatively, the
   Hackathon Chairs can share the presentation and advance slides for
   the presenter.

5.  Tooling

   The IETF Hackathon uses the same tooling used by the IETF community
   for its work and meetings.

5.1.  Datatracker

   The [DATATRACKER] supports the notion of Teams that are not part of
   the standards development process.  The Hackathon exists as one such
   Team.  From the datatracker menu, navigate to "Other" -> "Active
   Teams" -> "Hackathon".  Here exists a datatracker space for the
   Hackathon similar to what is available for working groups, including
   meeting materials, agendas, etc.  Initially, there was some attempt
   to copy materials hosted in the [IETF-HACKATHON-GITHUB] to the
   Datatracker.  Now this is done only when required for integration
   with other IETF tooling, including to:

   *  [REQUEST-SESSIONS] for the Hackathon kickoff and closing, and for
      Hackdemo Happy Hour

   *  post [AGENDAS]

5.2.  IETF Website

5.2.1.  Hackathon Website

   The IETF website includes a [HACKATHON-WEBSITE].  This website
   contains information about the Hackathon in general as well as links
   to past, present, and future Hackathons.  The relevant links are
   updated after each IETF meeting.  Other content on the website is
   updated on a more ad hoc basis.

5.2.2.  Meeting Website

   Each IETF [MEETING-WEBSITE] contains information about the
   corresponding Hackathon, including the dates of the Hackathon in the
   header and a link to the Hackathon website in the "Additional Events"
   section.

5.3.  Registration

   Registration for the Hackathon is through the IETF meeting
   [REGISTRATION-SYSTEM].  Participant registration for the Hackathon
   is:

   *  independent of participation registration for the meeting

   *  free

   *  required

   As with meeting registration, registrants for the Hackathon
   acknowledge the [NOTE-WELL] during the registration process.

5.3.1.  Participant List

   An active list of all registered participants, e.g., [PARTICIPANTS],
   is maintained by the Secretariat.  Important information displayed
   for each registrant includes the set of projects and technologies in
   which each participant is interested and an email address.  This
   information is optional at the time of registration and may be
   updated or removed by editing one's registration.

5.3.2.  Caps on Registrations

   Registrations were capped for the first several Hackathons.  This was
   done both for space and costs considerations.  The cap was hit
   multiple times, each time resulting in temporary confusion and
   frustration among would be registrants, followed by the cap being
   increased.  Currently, there are no caps enforced by the registration
   system.

5.4.  Meeting Wiki

   The [MEETING-WIKI] serves as the primary source of information for
   each Hackathon.

5.4.1.  Hackathon

   A page within the meeting wiki, e.g., [IETF-110-HACKATHON-WIKI], is
   created by the Secretariat for each Hackathon and initialized with
   information that is based largely on the information from the
   previous Hackathon.  Once created, the Hackathon Chairs update and
   moderate this page.  Champions are requested and responsible for
   adding information about projects for which they are a champion.

   Anyone can edit the wiki by logging in using their Datatracker login
   credentials.  Credentials can be obtained by creating a
   [DATATRACKER-ACCOUNT].

5.4.2.  Lost and Found

   A Lost and Found wiki page, e.g., [LOST-AND-FOUND], is created by the
   Chairs for each Hackathon.  Participants looking for a team are
   encouraged to add themselves to the "Skills to Offer" table,
   providing some information about their skills and interests.  This
   will help others with matching needs and/or interests find them.
   Champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to add their
   teams to the "Skills Needed" table, providing some information about
   the skills they seek.

5.4.3.  Results Presentation Schedule

   A Results Presentation Schedule wiki page, e.g.,
   [RESULTS-PRESENTATION-SCHEDULE], is created by the Chairs for each
   Hackathon.  Hackathon teams are welcome and encouraged to present
   their results during the Hackathon Closing.  Hackathon teams add the
   name of their project and the name of the presenter to the table at
   the bottom of this page.

5.4.4.  In Person Only

   The following wiki pages are applicable for in-person Hackathons
   only.

5.4.4.1.  Hackdemo Happy Hour

   A Hackdemo Happy Hour wiki page, e.g., [HACKDEMO], is created by the
   Chairs for each Hackathon.  Champions are welcome and encouraged to
   add their project by entering the project name/acronym and a contact
   name and email address in the table displayed on the page.

5.4.4.2.  Code Lounge

   A Code Lounge wiki page, e.g., [CODE-LOUNGE], is created by the
   Chairs for each Hackathon.  Champions are welcome and encouraged to
   add their project by entering the project name/acronym and a contact
   name and email address in the table displayed on the page.

5.4.5.  Online Only

   The following wiki pages are applicable for online Hackathons only.

5.4.5.1.  Team Schedule

   A Team Schedule wiki page, e.g., [TEAM-SCHEDULE], is created by the
   Chairs for each online only Hackathon.  Online only Hackathons take
   place globally for an entire week.  It is up to individual project
   teams to determine the preferred dates, times, and ways to meet to
   work on their project within the context of that week (e.g., Zoom,
   Webex, Slack).  This page is meant to help facilitate coordination of
   schedules within and across teams.

5.5.  Email List

   The Hackathon email list, [EMAIL-LIST], is used for all email
   communication and announcements related to the Hackathon.  All
   registrants are given the option to subscribe to the list.  Anyone
   interested in staying up to date on the Hackathon is able to
   subscribe at any time.  Once subscribed, anyone can send and respond
   to emails to the list.  The same list is used for each Hackathon.
   Anyone wishing to receive email for a specific Hackathon only can
   unsubscribe after that Hackathon has concluded.

5.5.1.  Hackathon Chairs Email Alias

   The email alias, [EMAIL-ALIAS], was created and is maintained by the
   Secretariat.  It is used on Hackathon webpages and wiki pages to
   provide a single point of contact for the Hackathon.

5.6.  GitHub

   The [IETF-HACKATHON-GITHUB] is used to share code, presentations, and
   other artifacts at IETF Hackathons.  The Hackathon Chairs are
   responsible for administering the GitHub organization.

   Code for Hackathon projects often exist elsewhere, which is perfectly
   fine.  Anyone needing a place to host code for the Hackathon can
   request the creation of a repository for their project.

   A repository is created and maintained by the Chairs for each
   Hackathon, e.g., [RESULTS-PRESENTATIONS].  This repo is for
   participants to upload project results presentations.  The contents
   of this repo are used as the source for all presentations at the end
   of the Hackathon and remain as a reference after the Hackathon.

5.7.  Meetecho

   [MEETECHO] is used for the kickoff and closing sessions of the
   Hackathon.  This provides many capabilities, including the following:

   *  allows participants to join Hackathon sessions in person or
      remotely

   *  validates registration of participants at time of joining
      Hackathon sessions

   *  enables remote presenters of project results presentations

   *  captures recording of Hackathon kickoff and closing

5.8.  Network

   Access to the IETF network is an important aspect of the Hackathon.
   The IETF network provides unfettered Internet access that is not
   typical within many residential, corporate, and university
   environments.  For many of IETF participants and projects, access to
   the Internet and each other via wireless access to the IETF network
   is sufficient.  However, due to the nature of the work done in the
   IETF, wired access and special networking capabilities are often
   required.

   The NOC has graciously met the needs of the Hackathon since its
   inception and continues to add more capabilities over time.
   Champions are able to request in advance wired access and special
   networking functionality, including static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
   IPv6 only networking, a closed user group, NAT64, and IPv6PD.  All of
   this, and the IETF network in general, is made available by the start
   of the Hackathon and in advance for setup to the extent possible.

5.8.1.  Remote Networking

   Online only meetings present both a personal networking challenge and
   a computer networking challenge.  The NOC came to the rescue for the
   latter with an experimental mechanism to join the IETF network while
   attending a meeting remotely.  This evolved into what is now known as
   [HACKNET], a global Layer 2 VPN designed to support IETF protocol
   development across teams within the IETF Hackathon.  A limited set of
   devices for connecting to HackNet are supported.  In addition to
   layer 2 connectivity, a subset of the networking capabilities
   available at in-person meetings are available.  Both the set of
   devices and the set of networking capabilities are expected to expand
   and evolve over time.  However, it is important to note that HackNet
   is still an experiment and not a production service.  Best effort
   support is available via email to [TICKET].

5.9.  Webex

   Champions can request a [WEBEX-ACCOUNT] they can use to schedule
   meetings for their team.  These are similar to the Webex accounts
   allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim
   meetings.  An account can be requested by a team champion at any
   time.  Accounts remain active and available throughout the duration
   of the Hackathon and the associated IETF meeting.  A project name may
   be used in place of "Working Group Name" in the request form.

5.10.  Gather

   [GATHER] facilitates virtual hallway interaction during IETF
   meetings.  A dedicated area within the overall space is created by
   the Secretariat for the Hackathon.  The area includes tables,
   identified by letters of the alphabet, that teams are free to self
   assign and use as and when they like.  Eight to ten seats around each
   table facilitate group discussions within the team.  A whiteboard or
   shared notes tablet, e.g., [HEDGEDOC], at tables facilitates sharing
   of information within the team.  The tables also facilitate
   collaboration across teams.  One cautionary note, Gather has relative
   high network bandwidth and CPU requirements, and as such may not be
   well suited for some Hackathon participants.

   The Gather space remains available between IETF meetings, with
   incremental improvements and additions made during this time.  The
   space is cleaned about a month prior to the start of the next
   meeting, removing anything left over from the previous meeting.
   Hackathon teams are encouraged to make a copy of anything they want
   to retain within a week of the end of the IETF meeting.

6.  Statistics and Metrics

   Statistics for the Hackathon have been gathered informally from the
   first Hackathon, at IETF 92, and more formally since IETF 101.
   Registration is required but it is also free, which can lead to
   misleading statistics.  Starting with IETF 101, an effort has been
   made by the Secretariat to validate registrations for all in-person
   participants by checking registrations at the main entrance to the
   Hackathon room.  Badges similar to those issued for the rest of the
   IETF meeting are now issued for the Hackathon as well.  There is
   still no good mechanism for determining the number of remote
   participants.

   Hackathon participation has grown from 45 at IETF 92 to a maximum of
   406 at IETF 104.  Participation tends to be slightly higher when the
   IETF meeting is located in Europe.  Recent in-person Hackathons have
   had roughly 30-40% as many participants as the corresponding IETF
   meeting.  For roughly 20-30% of Hackathon participants, the Hackathon
   is their first experience at any IETF event.

6.1.  IETF Survey Results

   For each IETF meeting, there is a post event survey that often
   includes a question or two about the Hackathon, e.g.,
   [IETF-106-SURVEY]

6.2.  Hackathon Survey Results

   Hackathon specific surveys have been used on some occasions to obtain
   more detailed feedback about the Hackathon from the IETF community.
   This has been especially useful for feedback on online only
   Hackathons.  Survey have been short with most questions being
   optional, e.g., [IETF-110-SURVEY].

7.  Roles and Responsibilities

   This section provides a summary of the roles and responsibilities of
   individuals and groups involved in a successful IETF Hackathon.  The
   summary provided here is not meant to be exhaustive.  Some
   responsibilities are described entirely or in more detail throughout
   the rest of the document.

7.1.  Hackathon Chair(s)

   The role of a Hackathon chair is similar to that of a working group
   chair.  As with working groups, it is typically best to have co-
   chairs share responsibilities and workload.  The Chairs work very
   closely with the Secretariat on all responsibilities.  Key
   responsibilities include:

   *  Organize and deliver a Hackathon at each IETF meeting, soliciting
      help from all other roles to do much of the heavy lifting

   *  Encourage and provide guidance to champions who volunteer to lead
      projects

   *  Maintain the Hackathon wiki, e.g., [IETF-110-HACKATHON-WIKI], and
      all of its child pages.

   *  Moderate Hackathon email list (Section 5.5)

   *  [REQUEST-SESSIONS] for the Hackathon opening and closing in the
      IETF meeting

   *  Emcee the Hackathon, including the opening and closing sessions
      and announcements in between

   *  Create and manage the GitHub repository used for each Hackathon,
      e.g.,[RESULTS-PRESENTATIONS]

   *  Serve as main point of contact for all Hackathon questions and
      concerns

7.2.  Secretariat

   Key responsibilities include:

   *  Configure and manage Hackathon registration system (Section 5.3)

   *  Maintain Hackathon website (Section 5.2.1)

   *  Create and maintain web page for each Hackathon, e.g.,
      [IETF-110-HACKATHON-WEBSITE]

   *  Create wiki page for each Hackathon, e.g.,
      [IETF-110-HACKATHON-WIKI].  This is initialized and updated at
      times by the Secretariat, but the Chair(s) are ultimately
      responsible for maintaining it.

   *  Handle venue logistics for Hackathon, Hackdemo Happy Hour, and
      Code Lounge (e.g., reserve room, food and beverages, AV, etc.)

   *  Internal IETF promotion (e.g., email messages to IETF community)

   *  Assist with external outreach, as needed, including finding
      sponsors

   *  Validate Hackathon registrations for in-person participants,
      including issuing badges and Hackathon t-shirts (Section 3.2.1.3)
      when available

7.3.  Sponsor

   Key responsibilities include:

   *  Provide some funding to help offset costs of Hackathon (either per
      meeting or per year, depending on model)

   *  Optionally provide t-shirts or other giveaways

   *  Optionally provide support staff to assist with Hackathon

   Key benefits include:

   *  Sponsor logo on Hackathon t-shirts

   *  Sponsor logo on Hackathon signage

   *  Sponsor logo on Hackathon webpage and wiki

   *  Sponsor logo and call out in Hackathon kickoff and closing
      presentation

   *  Sponsor logo and call out in IETF Plenary presentation

   *  Sponsor logo and call out in Hackathon recap on [IETF-BLOG]

   *  Recognition in IETF community for helping the IETF Hackathon
      remain free and open to everyone

7.4.  Champions of Projects

   Champions of projects are the key to a successful Hackathon.  Key
   responsibilities for champions include:

   *  Volunteer to lead a project at the Hackathon

   *  Serve as primary contact for the project

   *  Add and manage information on the Hackathon wiki for the project

   *  Promote the project to appropriate groups inside IETF and outside
      as well

   *  Welcome and organize members of the team

   *  Provide focus, guidance, and leadership for the project

7.5.  IETF LLC, Director of Communications and Operations (was ISOC)

   Key responsibilities include:

   *  Promotion outside of IETF, including web search engine ad words,
      social media posts, and listing on external event calendars such
      as [RIPE-CALENDAR] and [NSRC-CALENDAR].

   *  Outreach to local universities

   *  Provide photographer, including optional team photos and candid
      photos of collaborating during in-person events

   *  Laptop stickers (Section 3.2.1.4) at in-person events

7.6.  Judges

   The first several Hackathon involved judges who listened to project
   results presentations by teams at the closing of each Hackathon and
   identified winning teams for an arbitrary number of project
   categories.  Prizes were made available to members of winning teams.
   This was done as an incentive to participate in the Hackathon and
   present results, and to provide a fun yet informative end to the
   Hackathon that could be appreciated by the entire IETF community.
   Judging and awarding of prizes led to confusion regarding the nature
   of the Hackathon, making it appear to some overly competitive.
   Procurement of appropriate prizes was financially and logistically
   challenging.  Arrangement of judges, determination of winners, and
   awarding of prizes all became more time consuming, especially as the
   number of projects and participants grew.  Ultimately, it was deemed
   best to eliminate judging, awards, and prizes entirely.  Apparently
   the IETF community has an innate incentive to participate and present
   results in the Hackathon.

8.  Implementation Status

   The practices described in this document have been established, used,
   and refined over the course of running numerous IETF Hackathons,
   including several at online only IETF meetings.  The [GITHUB-REPO]
   GitHub repository has been used to collaborate on this document.  The
   IETF-Hackathon GitHub (Section 5.6) contains code associated with
   IETF Hackathons.

9.  Security Considerations

   HackNet (Section 5.8.1) enables Hackathon participants to join the
   IETF network while attending a meeting remotely.  The intent is for
   those connecting remotely to have as open a network as possible, just
   like those connecting to the IETF network at an in person meeting.  A
   user must have a datatracker account to access HackNet and is
   expected to respect it just as they are expected to respect the IETF
   network at an in person meeting.  If HackNet is exploited, it is
   addressed as an exploitation of the IETF network would be at an in
   person meeting.

9.1.  Privacy Considerations

   Participant names are displayed publicly in the Participant List
   (Section 5.3.1).  As part of their registration, participants may opt
   in to display their email address as well.

   The email addresses of individual champions are often shared publicly
   by the champions on the wiki.  This is done voluntarily by individual
   champions to make it easier for others to contact them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
